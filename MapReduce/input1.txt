As for the first-time expecting mothers, birth order may not be the direct cause of high level of stimulation.  Maybe the first-time mothers were more excited or nervous about being pregnant which lead to higher level of cortisol being released.  Or the pregnant mothers with children were too busy taking care of their children to feel excited or nervous.  Therefore the level of excitement or stress could be a better explanation for the level of stimulation.
