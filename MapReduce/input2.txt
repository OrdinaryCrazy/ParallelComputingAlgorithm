Although the siblings usually share similar genes, firstborn babies are not genetically identical to their younger brothers or sisters.  Therefore, the different levels of stimulation could result from the different genes of the infants.  Since the sample size was relatively small, it is possible that infants that are genetically geared towards releasing more cortisol happen to be firstborn.  Studies of larger random samples are necessary to tease out the effects of genes from the effects of birth order.
